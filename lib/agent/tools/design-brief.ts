/**
 * Plan-first creative direction for the in-app agent.
 *
 * Models produce a narrow band of safe, samey designs when they start building
 * immediately — committing to a direction BEFORE generating layers measurably
 * widens variety (the model can't fall back into its default groove mid-build).
 * `design_brief` makes that commitment an explicit, cheap tool call: the runtime
 * intercepts it (nothing is persisted) and, for full builds on a blank page,
 * refuses the first build call until a brief has been recorded (see runtime.ts).
 *
 * Agent-only, like load_tools — external MCP clients never see this tool.
